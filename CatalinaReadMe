LAPSforMac -- updated compatibility for 10.15 (Catalina)

Huge, huge kudos to Phil Redfern and the University of Nebraska for the original script. Additional kudo to Stephen Short for the work on Mojave and 
updating the LAPS script to resolve some quirks with the Jamf binary in High Sierra, resulting in odd behavior regarding secureToken and FileVault enablement.
I am making this zsh freindly ahead of the public Catalina release. TBH not much has changed, the original ReadMe's will still be helpful in setup and deployment.
Major changes of note are:

* Jamf $7 is now URL for API call if you have mutiple servers in your deployment and don't want to hardcode this
* Jamf binary if statements taken out and replaced with hard coded $ (not used if not running recon before exiting, simply comment both lines out: 53 & 230)
* My deployments password policy needs to be compliant with LAPS run, adding "Aq1*" and a tail end of the LAPS pw ensures compliance.
* ZSH!

(These are also added in comments at the top of the script since I always seem to forget)
